* How this works

** Setup procedure
There's a script in the project root called `setup'.

You can run it several times if you want, or if some step happens to
fail because the internet was broken or whatever.

It will make all the necessary directories, install all needed
programs, and so on.

** Periodic tasks
The setup installs a "cronjob" (chronological job) that updates stuff
from the internet once every hour.

This script can be found in `/etc/cron.hourly/dance-hourly`.

The tasks are:

   - updating the student file;
   - updating the calendar file;
   - and calculating "today's classes".
